# GBC-Q5-OSD-Delay

Designed for [this ATtiny85 board](https://github.com/orangeglo/Tiny85_SP_Breakout)

This code will simply wait 500ms before passing a pull-down button signal through to the output pad. It's designed for use with the Game Boy Color Q5 screen kit, to delay the select button signal that triggers the OSD.
